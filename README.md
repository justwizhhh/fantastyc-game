### A 2D top-down co-op party game, where players are tasked with exploring, and later placing new objects around, a Zelda-style dungeon. Players compete to get as much treasure as possible while hindering their opponents with the traps and obstacles they place down around the map!

Made in Unity 2023, and heavily inspired by Duck Game and Ultimate Chicken Horse. This is a project I worked in for around ~3 months in the summer of 2024, and is something I still add bits and pieces to, albeit in very scarce quantities, due to much of my time being consumed by university studies. 

Everything you see here is still very WIP (work-in-progress)! Any code-related feedback is appreciated.
