### A 2D top-down co-op party game, where players are tasked with exploring, and later placing new objects around, a Zelda-style dungeon. Players compete to get as much treasure as possible while hindering their opponents with the traps and obstacles they place down around the map!

Made in Unity 2023, and heavily inspired by Duck Game and Ultimate Chicken Horse. This is a project that I worked on for around ~3 months in the summer of 2024 as a basic game prototype to demonstrate its core features. Work on the project came to a hault once I had to shift my focus towards university studies.

Everything you see here is unfinished work-in-progress code that I never got around to cleaninig up and optimising!
